  # A [puffer][puffer] is an object that moves like a spaceship, except that it leaves debris behind. The first
  # known puffers were found by Bill Gosper and travelled at c/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for the very
  # first one, found in 1971). Not long afterwards c/12 diagonal puffers were found (see switch engine). Discounting
  # wickstretchers (which are not puffers in the conventional sense), no new velocity was obtained after this until
  # David Bell found the first c/3 orthogonal puffer in April 1996. Since then c/5 orthogonal puffers have also been
  # found, the first by Tim Coe in May 1997. Jason Summers built the first c/4 orthogonal puffer in January 1999,
  # and the first 2c/5 orthogonal puffer in February 1999. Hartmut Holzwart built the first c/4 diagonal puffer
  # (as opposed to a wickstretcher) in February 2004.
